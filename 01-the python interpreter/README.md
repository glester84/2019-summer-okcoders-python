# The Python Interpreter

## Week 1 objective
1. Introductions
1. Become familiar with how to start a python session
1. Understand the relationship between variables and values
1. Understand the basic flow control structures
1. Understand the basic code organization structures
1. It is NOT EXPECTED that you will memorize all the info on this page
1. We will cover functions and classes in more depth later, just covering a high level for now
1. Enter and manipulate data of various types

## Inspection
- dir(thing) -> prints a list of options for "thing"
- type(thing) -> prints the type of "thing"
- id(thing) -> prints a unique id of "thing"

## Values (data types)
__Simple__
- int
- float
- object (instance)
- class
- function
- string
- boolean
- None
- * (some types omitted)

__Composite__
- list
- tuple
- set
- dict
- * (some types omitted)

## Variables
- naming rules
- what they store
- how they are used

## Reserved Words
- True, False, None
- from, import, as
- nonlocal, global
- class, def, lambda
- try, except, finally, raise
- for, while, break, continue
- if, elif, else, pass
- return, yield
- and, or, not, is, in
- del, with
- assert

## Operations
- a special group of reserved words and other sequences
- math (+ - * / % // **)
- comparison (== != <> < > <= >=)
- assignment (= += -= *= /= //= **=)
- binary (& | ^ ~ << >>)

## Functions (def)
- defined locally or imported
- may or may not have arguments/parameters
- returns a value or None (or may raise an Exception) when called
- the function definition is not the same thing as a call to the function

## Classes (class)
- defined locally or imported
- may or may not have member functions and/or properties/attributes
- the class definition is not the same thing as an instance of the class
