Preclass Preparation
====================

For this course, we will start at https://www.python.org/shell/.
This is a fantastic introduction to python because it requires absolutely no setup on your machine.
It provides a way to interact with a python interpreter, but does not save any context from one session to the next.

In order to build and save a script or package, you will need to set up an account here:
https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/
These accounts are free and come with some limitations but will be sufficient for this course.
