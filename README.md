## Course Overview

The 8-week course is split into 2 4-week modules, with one week off in between, and will provide an introduction to application development with Python.
Classes will take place twice per week for the duration of the bootcamp — on Thursdays from 6pm-8pm and Saturdays from 9am-11am.
